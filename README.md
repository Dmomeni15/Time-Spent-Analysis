# Time-Spent-Analysis
One of the greatest anxieties of the past decade, especially prevalent among those using smartphones or other devices, is how much time is wasted throughout their day as a result of unnecessary distractions. The purpose of this project is to determine how one subject’s time is spent, what underlying patterns exist, and how different hypotheses regarding human behavior may come into play. The main portion of this project will consist of a spectral analysis (i.e. Fourier transform) of the encoded activity data, after splitting time blocks into 5-minute intervals. Further analysis will involve hierarchical clustering and a generalized linear model (GLM) on extracted features, which can shine some light on numerous hypotheses such as ego depletion and the predictive potential of activities performed during the first hour of any given day. Significant predictors in this analysis will be crucial in optimizing the subject’s productivity, in addition to confirming or rejecting the applicability of the aforementioned hypotheses.
